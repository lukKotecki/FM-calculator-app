Calculator app
Some similar features are handled differently because I wanted to practice some skills. 
The most challenging part was to provide order of mathematical operations, for ex: 2+2*2=6 instead of 8. I handled this with an array of input because I also wanted to implement undo operation with 'DEL' button. Clunky and heavy code need refactor but it's works.
