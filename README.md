Some similar features are handled differently because I wanted to practice some skills. The most challenging part was to provide order of mathematical operations, for ex: 2+2*2=6 instead of 8. I handled this with an array of input because I also wanted to implement undo operation with 'DEL' button. It's clunky and heavy code but it works.
